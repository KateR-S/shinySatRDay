# Assignment: This app doesn't work! It's supposed to let
# the user click on the plot, and have a data point appear
# where the click occurs. But as written, the data point
# only appears for a moment before disappearing.
# 
# This happens because each time the plot is re-rendered,
# the value of input$click is reset to NULL, and thus
# userPoint() becomes NULL as well.
# 
# Can you get a single user-added data point to stay?
# 
# Bonus points: Can you include not just the single most
# recent click, but ALL clicks made by the user?
# 
# Hint: You'll need to replace reactive() with a combo
# of reactiveValues() and observeEvent().
